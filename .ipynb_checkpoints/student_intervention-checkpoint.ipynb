    "\n",
    "### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors:\n",
    "Finds the mean (weighted) of the k nearest datapoints to the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "This supervised learning model is used in some forms of predictions in the real world, one of them being text mining - as stated in reasearch papers like this one : [`KNN based Machine Learning Approach for Text and Document Mining`](http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJDTA/vol7_no1/6.pdf). Another wide application of this model is in economic forcasting.\n",
    " ##### Strengths:\n",
    "   - As this is a Instance based learning model, it has almost 0 training time for the data, as all the computation is done only when a query is passed.\n",
    "   - This is also known as a lazy learning model, as it approximates a value for a query locally for k nearest terms, instead of using the entire dataset. \n",
    "   - This model will be extremely useful if the training data is changed constantly, because it does all the predictions only during the time of a query and not everytime the training dataset is updated.\n",
    "   - Outliers are always ignored while predicting( provided k!=n), as it will almost always be the farthest point from the query, hence tending to give pretty accurate predictions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "##### Weaknesses:\n",
    "- As this is an instance based learning model, querying on this dataset will take considerably longer when compared to any other non-instance based learning models, which will be a problem if queries are passed very often.\n",
    "- Also, as this approach is based on computing during a query, the model does not actually learn anything, and hence cannot generalize the given data in any way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model is one of the best, if not the best candidate, as based on the input data, we need to figure out if a student needs early intervention or not. What better way to do this than to compare this student with other students who have similar features and whether or not these similar students ended up graduating or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Support Vector Machines:\n",
    "Finds a line that linearly seperates the given data via kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVM learning model have proven to be very accurate when it comes to certain real world applications like Text Categorization ['Text Categorization with Support Vector\n",
    "Machines'](http://web.cs.iastate.edu/~jtian/cs573/Papers/Joachims-ECML-98.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Strengths:\n",
    " - It scales relatively well to high dimensional data when compared to other learning models.\n",
    " - We can explicitly control the complexity of the model.\n",
    " - The use of kernels is a great advantage as we can mould the dataset into various form of our own to find the best fit. \n",
    " \n",
    "##### Weaknesses:\n",
    " - A poor choice of a kernel will result in high error rates, and hence for a SVM to perform optimally, we need to know which would be the best kernel to be using for a given dataset.\n",
    " - Training a dataset takes longer when a more complex kernel is used, and this could be a hinderance when complex models are being procesed\n",
    " \n",
    "This model is a very good choice, as it converts the training data into a linearly seperable model and find the best way of classifying the data into 2 parts, and hence should have very accurate predictions for the unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Ensemble Classifier: Bagging Classifier\n",
    "If a dataset of x datapoints is given, it draws x instances from which the model learns, and this can be repeated several times and put together to get an accurate dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This classifier is used in various fields of research, and there are numerous articles which show its wide range of applications: ['ensemble modeling for nosiheptide fermentation process']('http://fulltext.study/preview/pdf/1181281.pdf')\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Strengths:\n",
    " - it is an excellent model to handle data of mixed type.\n",
    " - It tends to keep the variance as low as possible. \n",
    " \n",
    "##### Weaknesses:\n",
    "- Increased computation time with increase in the size of the dataset as it creates a large number of instances and learns from them.\n",
    "- Also, it requires a lot of memory to compute these instances. \n",

This model has a way lesser training time when compared to other classifiers, and the training time appears to be constant (or a very low increase with respect to increase in data), where as the in the support vector machines classifier, the training time seems to be increasing exponentially when more training data is provided. The bagging classifier seems to also be taking a lot of time to Choosing this classifier will ensure results are obtained without much delay. Considering the fact that this school data base will be updated regularly as more student graduate, we will need to maintain a low training time.\n",
